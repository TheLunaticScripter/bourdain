1. Trust chef on how to articulate policy and how to converge
2. Trust the authorities on whether the policy is good or bad (Chef is not an Authority)
3. Customer trusts itself as the authority on the implementation of the convergence (Chef is not an Authroity greater than the customer)
4. Ability to verify the trust chain at all levels (Trust but verify). All trust models should be considered (High trust, Low Trust, No Trust)
5. Through a chain of custody at all levels we transfer transitive trust to either Chef or the Customer from the Authority
